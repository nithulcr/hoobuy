                   Documents issued within the UAE—whether educational, personal, legal, or commercial—often require attestation before they can be used outside the country. This process validates the authenticity of the document and ensures it is internationally recognised. UAE-issued certificates must typically pass through local ministries, courts, notary public offices, and embassy channels before they are accepted abroad.

                  HooBuy assists clients by managing every step of this journey. Whether it is a degree issued by a UAE university, a birth or marriage certificate issued by Dubai Courts or Abu Dhabi Judicial Department, or commercial documents issued by the economic department, each document undergoes precise verification. Our team liaises with relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, and the MOFA UAE, and completes embassy legalisation for the destination country.
