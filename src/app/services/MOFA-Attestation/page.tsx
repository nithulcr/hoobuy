                    MOFA attestation is the final and most essential stage for any document intended for use within the UAE. Regardless of how many authorities have previously verified a document—whether in the issuing country or at its embassy—the UAE government requires every foreign document to be authenticated by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs before it is considered legally valid.

                    At HooBuy, we handle MOFA attestation as a seamless extension of the entire legalisation journey. We manage the submission, verification, approval, and final collection, ensuring that the process is as quick and stress-free as possible. Since MOFA attestation requires precise documentation and fee payments, our team ensures everything is prepared in advance so there are no delays.
