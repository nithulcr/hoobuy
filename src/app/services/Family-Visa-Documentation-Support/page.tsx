                    Starting a business in the UAE is a remarkable opportunity. The country’s dynamic economy, strategic geographic location, tax benefits, and global connectivity make it one of the most attractive business destinations in the world. Yet, behind the promise of success lies a detailed path of approvals, legal clearances, documentation requirements, and licensing procedures that can overwhelm even the most experienced entrepreneurs. Understanding this complexity, DealBuyHomes provides a complete business setup support system designed to make company formation effortless, transparent, and fast.

                    When a business idea takes shape, our role begins with guiding entrepreneurs through the UAE’s different company structures—mainland, freezone, and offshore.

DealBuyHomes takes the time to understand your business model, commercial goals, and future expansion plans before recommending the most suitable formation route.

Every document—whether a passport copy, shareholder agreement, MOA, AOA, tenancy contract, bank reference, or corporate resolution—is meticulously checked and processed.

                    DealBuyHomes also assists with office space requirements, obtaining Ejari or lease contracts when needed, and managing investor visas and employee visas associated with the new company. Our role extends beyond the initial setup. We support renewals, modifications, license upgrades, and approvals required for business expansion.
