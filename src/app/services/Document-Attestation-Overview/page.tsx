                  <p className='font-light'>Document attestation is the process of validating a document’s authenticity so it can be legally accepted in another country. It is a crucial requirement for visas, employment, education, family sponsorships, and corporate activities. Attestation involves a sequence of approvals, each confirming that the document is genuine and has been issued by the appropriate authority. Since every country follows a different attestation structure, the process can quickly become overwhelming for individuals who are unfamiliar with international legal procedures.

                    HooBuy ensures that your documents move through every stage smoothly. We begin by reviewing the document for formatting errors, incorrect details, or missing seals. Once verified, the document proceeds through various departments such as notary offices, state authorities, foreign ministries, and international embassies. The final stage often includes MOFA attestation, which makes the document valid inside the UAE.
